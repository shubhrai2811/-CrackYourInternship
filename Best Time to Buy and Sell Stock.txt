Approach -
the code iterates over the prices and keeps track of the minimum price seen so far (minp). 
It also calculates the maximum profit that can be achieved by selling the stock on each day and updates maxpro accordingly. 
At the end of the loop, the maximum profit is returned.


code-
```
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int minp=INT_MAX;
        int maxpro=0;
        for(int i=0;i<prices.size();i++){
            minp=min(minp,prices[i]);
            maxpro=max(maxpro,prices[i]-minp);
        }
        return maxpro;
    }
};
```
